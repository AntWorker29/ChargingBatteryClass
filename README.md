# ChargingBatteryClass
C# program that simulates the motion of charging a phone battery

The battery class will simulate charging a 7-dash battery.

The movement is a progressive one, starting from the first line (bottom) and ending when the battery has all 7 lines full then it erases itself and starts again.

It functions in loop.
